# old reddit dark mode

When you just want dark mode on old reddit. This extension just injects a dark mode stylesheet into old.reddit.com and uses the user preference setting to detect if the user has requested a light or dark color theme.

The user might indicate this preference through an operating system setting (e.g. light or dark mode) or a user agent setting.

Not related to RES but uses the dark style sheet from RES.
